In 1893, Mohandas K. Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian and traveling in a first class compartment. Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.—gavin (gunmasterM@hotmail.com)"""

He goes to a hill station somewhere in the North for an ad shoot. But due to a work commitment in Delhi, he leaves from the hill town despite heavy snow. On the way, he takes a shortcut to Delhi but due to a tree fall, he gets stuck. On top of it, his car suddenly breaks down.

Paramjeet takes him to the house of Jagdish Acharya (Dhritiman Chatterjee) where Hariya Jatav (Raghubir Yadav) is already present. Soon, Lateef Zaidi (Amitabh Bachchan) also joins them. The quartet then informs Sameer that they meet every day and play a unique game. As part of this game, they conduct a mock trial since all of them are retired law professionals. While Jagdish Acharya was a retired judge in a nearby court, Paramjeet was defense counsel and Lateef was chief prosecutor. They invite Sameer to play this game. Sameer agrees. The quartet tells him that he'll be the accused in their court of law. Paramjeet would defend him while Lateef would try to prove that he's guilty. Jagdish, meanwhile, would be the judge. Lateef gives Sameer a chance to confess if he has ever done any crime and got away with it. Then they'll try him for that charge. Sameer, however, confidently tells that he has never committed any crime. Lateef then gets a chance to try him for any crime he desires. In the course of their conversation, Sameer blurts out that he used to detest his ex-boss, G S Oswal (Samir Soni) as he was a tyrant. Sameer also reveals that Oswal died recently and that he took over his position. At this, Lateef decides to try him in their court for the 'murder' of Oswal. Sameer is aghast and makes it clear that he hasn't killed him. But Lateef tells the court that he's willing to put his legal reputation at stake and that he'll never play this game ever again if he fails to prove that Sameer hasn't been a part of Oswal's 'murder'. Sameer is a bit apprehensive but then he realizes he need not worry as it's just a game. But his worries vanish instantly when he finds out that Hariya Jatav was not a lawyer or judge. He was actually a hangman and that he has kept the noose ready, should the accused is proven guilty in their court. What happens next forms the rest of the film.—https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/chehre/"""

Vishal does not support this, because his terms and conditions of his future brother-in-law are very strenuous physically. And he decides to bring Muskaan back on the farm. Suraj obviously pursues her and starts working on the farm as a stable boy after a chance meeting with 'Chachu'. And then Vishaul decides to put him to the test, and he is rejected. Vishaal wants Muskaan to marry the brother of Thakur Vijay Singh (Nirmal Pandey), not knowing that Thakur Vijay Singh is doing this to merely extract vengeance against the Thakur family for a previous humiliation his own family received. So Suraj must now prevent this from happening and he must also be able to win Vishal's heart if he is really interested in marrying Muskaan (Vishal's sister).—gavin@sunny_deol2009@yahoo.com"""

A horrified Surjit attempts to convince the Judge to change his ruling, but in vain and he is transported to his new penitentiary where he meets with hostile villagers who would rather kill him than let him toil on their sacred land.

Bhagat Singh was born in British India during the year 1908. As a child he witnessed numerous atrocities committed on fellow Indians by their British rulers, who came to trade under the guise of the East India Company, but ended up controlling most of the nation, and permitting tyrants such as General Dyer to massacre thousands of innocent men, women and children in Jallianwala Baug. As a child he was impressed by Mohandas K. Gandhi, especially his call to launch the non-cooperation movement, which led to thousands of people burning British-made clothing, giving up schools, and college studies, and government jobs - only to be let down by Gandhi himself when he called off the movement. Undaunted, Bhagat decided to be a revolutionary, starting with getting into petty fights, then as a grown-up joining the Hindustan Republic Association. When Lala Lajpat Rai was beaten to death by the police, Bhagat, along with Shivram Rajguru, Sukhdev, and others daringly carried out the assassination of a police officer named Saunders, which eventually led to Bhagat's arrest, where he was lodged in a cell, tortured and beaten mercilessly. His father, Kishan, paid Rs.60,000/- and bailed him out, so that he could get him to run a diary-farm and get married to a girl from Manavali. But being a revolutionary was in Bhagat's blood, and when the British proposed the Trade Disputes and Public Safety Bills, he would initiate the bombing in the Indian Parliament Building, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, be arrested, and tried in an open court. This is where Bhagat launched his much-publicized revolution, and became popular with the masses, especially the younger generation, laborers, and farmers, so much so that his popularity rivaled that of Gandhi himself. Even in prison, Bhagat made headline news when he and other prisoners undertook a 63 day fast unto death to improve the conditions of Indian freedom-fighter prisoners. Then the British re-opened the Saunders' murder case, which led to death sentences being imposed on Bhagat, Shivram, and Sukhdev. The entire nation rose up in protest, including the Congress party - with the ball being in Gandhi's court - for he was due to sign the Irwing Pact, and Indians hoped that he would use this as a bargaining chip to save the lives of the heroic trio. Will Gandhi rise up to the occasion and save the trio - so that they could pave the way for a modern and independent India, not just a country ruled by the British with a dominant status - an India free of communal hatred, injustice, corruption, and fundamentalism, or will Gandhi end up disappointing Bhagat all over again?—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"""

The film begins with a disclaimer, stating that RETURN OF HANUMAN is not a sequel to any film made before. But is it really possible to watch the new experience forgetting all about the first part? As someone who thoroughly enjoyed HANUMAN, you expect an encore with RETURN OF HANUMAN, although the makers, for reasons best known to them, have decided to alienate the new film with the first animation film on Lord Hanuman. The makers may have their reasons, but for the viewer, the comparisons are inevitable. Write your own movie review of Return Of Hanuman Honestly speaking, one shouldn't compare the two films for a very valid reason. While HANUMAN was a pure mythological film, RETURN OF HANUMAN merges mythology with the present-day kalyug ki duniya. In this film, there's Gabbar Singh, plus voice-over clones of, hold your breath, Shah Rukh Khan, Sanjeev Kumar and Raaj Kumar. What's more, Baby Hanuman handles a volley of bullets like Keanu Reeves handled them in the MATRIX series. RETURN OF HANUMAN begins with the battle between the gods and rakshas. The focus shifts to a small kid, Minku, in a small village in present-day India, who's ridiculed by his friends. Lord Hanuman requests Narad Muni to convince Lord Brahma to send him to earth. Lord Brahma agrees, but Lord Hanuman is made to sign a contract, which has several do's and don'ts. It's innovative to merge mythology with the contemporary and a number of sequences do make an impression, especially in the first hour. But the film drags in the post-interval portions and a long-drawn climax only dilutes the impact of several interesting sequences.—lord.aryan@gmail.com"""

For this purpose he joined hands with stalwarts such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohandas Gandhi, but expressed his frustration, especially with Gandhi's slowgan and painstaking way of trying to win over the enemy with love. This is the reason he decided to separate from the Congress Party. The British became weary of him, placed him under arrest, but when he started a hunger strike unto death, they let him go, but kept him under surveillance. Subhas eluded the police, under the guise of Pathan Mohammad Ziauddin, crossed the Indian border in Afghanistan so that he could enter Russia and form an Indian Army to oust the British. His efforts failed, he ended up as Italian Orlando Mashtar, with an office in Germany. He did manage to convince the Nazis, despite of Hitler's views in ""Main Kempf"" that he preferred India to remain colonized under the British. Nevertheless he was permitted recruit Indian-born British soldiers prisoners of war, and this is how the movement began. He secretly married his German Secretary, Emily Sanken, and did earn the ire of the Germans, who wanted to keep their race pure (Caucasian). His efforts to take his army to India through Russia and Afghanistan were in vain as Adolf Hitler declared war on Russia. Leaving his German-based army, Subhas journeyed to Singapore via a submarine, from there he entered into an agreement with the Japanese. And it was with the help of the Japanese that he marched an army of approximately 8000 troops, both men and women, against the might of the British. It was here that he was informed that he had become the father of Anita. Then, fate again played a cruel hand, when America entered the war, atom-bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally.

The film serves as a critique of the decadence and complacency of the Indian aristocracy during the colonial era, juxtaposed with the ruthless ambition and exploitation of the British Empire. It also explores themes of power, privilege, and the consequences of apathy in the face of oppression. In the end, ""The Chess Players"" serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities of history and the importance of remaining vigilant and engaged in the face of political turmoil and injustice.—SunMaximusOne"""

Just as Sunny is cynical about life, Michael Burnett (Boman Irani) is optimistic about it. 51 year old Michael is a simple minded man, almost childlike and has recently landed job as a pizza delivery boy at Mummy's Pizza.

He is also in the process of writing a script for Bollywood film-maker Karan Johar. He is prone to taking freebies all the time, for instance he will order pizza from Mommy's Pizza, which guarantees delivery within 30   or the pizza is free. When the pizza arrives, usually on time, he refuses to pay up claiming that the pizza is late and he is thus entitled to it free of any cost.

Ethel, however, wishes that he placed as much effort into being at home with her as he does in selling; his current job of peddling five-spindle milkshake makers for Prince Castle which has him constantly on the road going from one drive-in restaurant to another. It is because of the beefs he has with the whole drive-in experience (bad food, bad service) in constantly eating at such establishments while on the road that he becomes enthralled with the concept of McDonald's Restaurant in San Bernardino, California, owned and operated by brothers Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald - Dick and Mac. Unlike most of Ray's customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant. Primarily on Dick's initiative, the brothers have redesigned the whole concept of the drive-in restaurant to focus on quality food through a smaller menu of only the most popular items (hamburgers, fries, sodas), consistency in product so that customers know what to expect from time to time, change in the target market from lounging teenagers to families, and perhaps most importantly speed in having any order ready within seconds, many of these goals achievable through assembly line styled production. They had tried franchising previously, but failed in that they lost control over many of those aspects which made their San Bernardino restaurant successful. Despite believing Ray a bit off kilter (in other words, crazy), the McDonald brothers somewhat hesitantly enter into a contract with him to be their head of franchising. Ray's experience in the job is not without its problems, especially as his franchisees seem to be making more money than he is, he who is only breaking even. He is not averse to advancing ideas provided to him to get ahead - original ideas which are not his forte - he seeing the brothers as his biggest problem in they thinking small.

He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years.

Of course, no one knows why the cruel patriarch and his frigid wife deliberately keep their submissive children in the dark. After all, they say ignorance is bliss--freedom is nothing but a word. But nothing lasts forever. And when corrosive influence in the shape of young security guard Christina enters the equation, sweet, baffling temptation threatens years of meticulous mind-programming. Is the grass greener on the other side of the fence? With this in mind, how can an ordinary dogtooth stand in the way of happiness?—Nick Riganas"""
